This project is funded by the "Soochow University Undergraduate Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program", project number: 202210285006Z.

Currently, People's Daily provides an electronic version of its content, which can be accessed for free through the official website (People's Daily-People's Network) for the past two years. In addition, the old archives of People's Daily from 1946 to 2003 are archived on the old archives website, which can be crawled through web crawler technology.

In view of this, the research team developed a crawler library, which is intended to be an important part of the fact-checking database.

During the two-year Dachuang project, we collected data from 2018 to 2023 and from 1946 to 2003, and laid the foundation for the fact-checking database to be implemented in the future. In order to further enrich and improve the coverage of the database, we plan to introduce more data resources from official media in the subsequent stage, in order to achieve the comprehensiveness and authority of the database content. Through empirical verification, our project results can be effectively combined with LLM models (such as Tongyi Qianwen and GPT) to detect false news by fine-tuning the model. Currently, our project team is planning to submit this result to an international conference.

当前，人民日报提供其内容的电子版本，该电子报纸可通过官方网站（人民日报-人民网）免费访问近两年的出版物。此外，老资料网存档了1946至2003年间的人民日报档案，均可通过网络爬虫技术进行数据抓取。

鉴于此，本研究团队开发了一个爬虫库，旨在将其作为事实核查数据库的重要组成部分。

在为期两年的大创项目期间，我们收集了2018年至2023年以及1946年至2003年的数据，并搭建了未来将要实施的事实核查数据库的基础。为了进一步丰富和完善数据库的覆盖范围，我们计划在后续阶段引入更多来自官方媒体的数据资源，以期实现数据库内容的全面性和权威性。通过实证验证，我们的项目成果能够有效地与LLM模型（如通义千问和GPT结合）相结合，通过微调模型来检测虚假新闻。目前，我们的项目组正计划将这一成果投稿到国际会议上。
